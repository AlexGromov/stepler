Stepler framework is intended to provide the community with a testing framework that is capable of perform advanced scenario and destructive test cases, like batch instances launching, instances migration, services restarts and different HA-specific cases.

This solution is not intended for OpenStack API validation, but provides simple tool for creation tests to check advanced end-user scenarios.
